### Running the app - once the website folder has been downloaded and unzipped  
```python 
# Go to the folder by typing 
cd foldername 
```  
### To run the file that contains the dash app, in this case **app.py**  
```python
python app.py
```  
#### This will render the localhost address, this address can then be opened in the browser of choice - i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8050/

#### **Note:** if you do not have the required packages you must type this in your command prompt (or Git), Terminal (MacOS)  
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
#### *requirements.txt* contains all the libraries and dependencies needed to run **app.py**
